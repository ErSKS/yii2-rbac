Electronics can also be defined as physics of electrons and their utilization. It is the study of how electrons behave and how they can be controlled so that they can do useful jobs. Electronics can also be referred to as &lsquo;<em>the field of science and engineering, which deals with electronic devices and their utilization</em>&rsquo;. An&nbsp;<em>electronic device</em>&nbsp;is a device in which conduction takes place by the movement of electrons through vacuum, gas or semiconductor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">A tiny electronic component requires very minute power in the range of milliwatts or microwatts to function, but it can control or do works involving kilowatts or megawatts of power. Thus, it is not surprising to find the fundamentals of electronics being the core subject in all branches of engineering nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Nearly all the machines we use in our everyday lives from radios, calculators and television remote controls to telephones, computers and cars contain electronic circuits that make them work. Electronics is the backbone of information technology and communications. Although each of these areas represents a remarkable advance in technology, underlying the field of electronics are basically the general principles of electricity. All the applications of electronics make use of the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The study of electronics began at the end of the nineteenth century and had its first practical use in the early twentieth century in the development of radio communications. The first electronic devices were called thermionic valves. These included the diode valve, which allowed the flow of current in one direction but not in the other and triode in which a small current could be used to control a much larger current. These valves were either vacuum type or gas filled. In 1950s, semiconductor devices quickly replaced valves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The invention of semiconductor transistor revolutionized every field of human life. Compared to the conventional tubes, these semiconductor devices are very compact, simple, more reliable and efficient. Since the size of the components reduced to a very large extent, electronic circuits were fabricated on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), which are very small and simple. The semiconductor devices are mounted on the board and the interconnections between the components are established easily by etching the conducting tracks on the board. These electronic circuits are very compact and are capable of doing almost any job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">The development of the Integrated Circuits (ICs) made electronics occupy all possible fields in domestic, industrial, medical and defence applications. An IC is an electronic circuit that is much more compact compared to PCB circuits in that the components as well as the total circuits are fabricated on a single substrate. Very complex circuits could be fabricated on a single simple substrate, reducing the size of the electronic circuits to microscopic level. The growth of the IC fabrication techniques is tremendously high&mdash;these days millions of transistors are fabricated on to a single microscopic-sized IC. With these drastic developmental changes in IC fabrication, the growth of IC applications is extremely rapid and has occupied all walks of life. Ultra-high-speed electronic devices were possible due to miniature-sized components. The speed with which an electronic gadget can operate is of the order of gigacycles per second. This tremendous speed of operation has enabled the electronic engineer to devise new gadgets to meet all possible human requirements. These minute electronic components can control extremely large cargo ships at sea, gigantic steel mills, small robots and so on. It is no wonder today that these tiny electronic components do the most wondrous things in this wonderful world of ours. The evolution of digital logic and digital electronics is the basic boost to the developments in the fields of computer science, information technology, communications and allied fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Electronics and communication engineering is an engineering discipline which uses the scientific knowledge of the behavior and effects of electrons to develop components, devices, systems, or equipment that uses&nbsp;electricity&nbsp;as part of its driving force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Electronics engineering is an engineering discipline where non-linear and active electrical components such as electron tubes, and semiconductor devices, especially transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, are utilized to design electronic circuits, devices and systems, typically also including passive electrical components and based on printed circuit boards. The term denotes a broad engineering field that covers important subfields such as analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control, robotics, and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering deals with the electronic devices, circuits, communication equipments like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits (IC). It also deals with basic electronics, analog and digital transmission &amp; reception of data, voice and video (Example AM, FM, DTH), microprocessors, satellite communication, microwave engineering, antennae and wave progression. It aims to deepen the knowledge and skills of the students on the basic concepts and theories that will equip them in their professional work involving analysis, systems implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various applications in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">Every industry, institution &amp; organization feels the need for an Electronics Engineer.

Base isolation is one of the most widely accepted seismic protection systems in earthquake prone areas. It mitigates the effect of an earthquake by essentially isolating the structure from potentially dangerous ground motions. Seismic isolation is a design strategy, which uncouples the structure for the damaging effects of the ground motion. The term isolation refers to reduced interaction between structure and the ground. When the seismic isolation system is located under the structure, it is referred as &ldquo;base isolation&rdquo;.
